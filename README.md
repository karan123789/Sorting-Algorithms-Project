# Sorting-Algorithms-Project




This sorting algorithms project encompasses a variety of sorting techniques including selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. The final function in this project is designed to determine if a selected student's SAT score (or a portion of it) is greater than the median SAT score of current MSU students. The algorithm calculates the median by finding the middle value of the dataset or, in the case of an even number of elements, the average of the middle two elements. It's worth noting that the project excludes the use of built-in sort functions or provided quicksort functions, but allows for the implementation of the aforementioned sorting algorithms to achieve the desired functionality efficiently.



Functions I completeds include: do_comparison, selection_sort, bubble_sort, insertion_sort, hybrid_merge_sort, merge_sort, merge, get_median, better_than_most



NOTE: Rest of the functions were pre-defined and provided to me when completing this project and were not completed or changed by me
